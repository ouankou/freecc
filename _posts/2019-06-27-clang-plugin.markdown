Clang Plugins make it possible to run extra user defined actions during a compilation. The **[Clang documentation](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangPlugins.html)** already includes a good tutorial on Plugin development, so we wonâ€™t elaborate too much on it.  

In this tutorial we will cover how to build a clang plugin out of the LLVM build tree.
