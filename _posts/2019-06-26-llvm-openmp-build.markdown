Llvm-8.0.0 now has GPU offloading support in their OpenMP implementation. But building and using this offloading support can sometimes be confusing. I have tried several ways of building LLVM, and failed several times. Finally I found a way which works for me. Personally I prefer to first build and install llvm/clang, and then use this installation to build OpenMP-8.0.0. This is the way which worked for me. In this tutorial I will be explaining the steps to first build llvm-8.0.0 with clang-8.0.0 and then use it to build openmp-8.0.0 with offloading support.

# Tips:

Code snippets are shown in one of three ways throughout this environment:

1. Code that looks like `this` is sample code snippets that is usually part of an explanation.
2. Code that appears in box like the one below can be clicked on and it will automatically be typed in to the appropriate terminal window:
```.term1
vim readme.txt
```

3. Code appearing in windows like the one below is code that you should type in yourself. Usually there will be a unique ID or other bit your need to enter which we cannot supply. Items appearing in <> are the pieces you should substitute based on the instructions.

LLVM is already built and installed ($LLVM_PATH) in this environment. The LLVM source code can be found on $LLVM_SRC. A normal LLVM build might take a couple of hours to complete. The next section (section A) is for people who want to learn about how to install LLVM. If you  are just interested in building OpenMP in LLVM please go to [Section B](#openmp). 

## A. Building llvm-8.0.0 with CMake
**[CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)**  is a cross-platform build-generator tool. CMake does not directly build the project, it generates the files needed by our build system *(GNU make, ninja, etc.)* for building LLVM.
 
We can either download the tar files from **[LLVM Download page](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html)** or we can checkout from their git repo. Here I will be using the download page, but git works in similar way.

### A.1 Prerequisite softwares:
1. GNU cmake (version 2.8 and above)
2. Gcc (version 5 and above. Keep below version 7 for OpenMP)
3. Python (version 2.7 and above)

All three software packages have been installed in the terminal on the right side. We just need to confirm this:
```
$ which gcc
$ which cmake
$ which python
```

### A.2 Setup the following environment variables in our system
The follow environment variables have already been set in the terminal on the right side. We just need to confirm this: 
```
$ echo $LLVM_SRC
$ echo LLVM_PATH=<Path where LLVM need to be installed>
```

### A.3 Download LLVM and Clang
Go to LLVM_SRC path
```.term1
cd $LLVM_SRC
```
Get the llvm-8.0.0 source file
```.term1
wget http://releases.llvm.org/8.0.0/llvm-8.0.0.src.tar.xz
```
Untar llvm-8.0.0.src.tar.xz
```.term1
tar -xf llvm-8.0.0.src.tar.xz
```
Goto llvm-8.0.0.src/tools
```.term1
cd llvm-8.0.0.src/tools
```
Get the clang source file
```.term1
wget http://releases.llvm.org/8.0.0/cfe-8.0.0.src.tar.xz
```
Untar cfe-8.0.0.src.tar.xz 
```.term1
tar -xf cfe-8.0.0.src.tar.xz
```
Return back to LLVM_SRC path
```.term1
cd $LLVM_SRC
```
### A.4.1 Build with make
Create a build directory and get into it
```.term1
mkdir build && cd build
```
Run the cmake command. Here we are building llvm-8.0.0 and clang-8.0.0 using make build system.
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE specifies the build type on single-configuration generators. Here we are giving the build type as RELEASE. We can also use DEBUG, if we want to build llvm in debug mode.
```WARNING``` - building llvm in debug mode will normally consume over 20GB of our space.

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX specifies the install directory used by install command.

Other commonly used parameter are CMAKE_C_COMPILER and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER for telling make which C compiler to use.
```.term1
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$LLVM_PATH $LLVM_SRC/llvm-8.0.0.src
```
For boosting performance sometimes we can use the /dev/shm as our temporary directory. /dev/shm is a temporary file storage filesystem, i.e., tmpfs, that uses RAM for the backing store. In an incremental build system a lot of temporary files are created while compilation. /tmp is the location for temporary files as defined in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, which is followed by almost all Unix and Linux distributions. This location is access by the TMPDIR environment variable. To make the process of compilation faster we can set the TMPDIR environment variable to point to a tmpfs directory, like /dev/shm. Caution should be taken before enabling this option. If we do not have enough RAM, this step might have an adverse effect on compilation.
```.term1
export TMPDIR=/dev/shm 
```
Once the required build files are created, we can start building using make. We can create as many threads as the number of processors. For instance, suppose your system has 4 cores on a node. So on this system we can run this command as make -j4. This will speedup the build process. ```WARNING``` - the make command will take a couple of hours to complete.

```.term1
make -j4
```
make install installs all the built llvm/clang files to the LLVM_PATH location.

```.term1
make install
```

### A.4.2 Build with Ninja (Optional)
**[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org)** is much faster than make. Where other build systems are high-level languages Ninja aims to be an assembler. Ninja build files are human-readable but not especially convenient to write by hand. These constrained build files allow Ninja to evaluate incremental builds quickly.

To build ninja supported files, we use the option -G Ninja

CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS enables or disables output of compile commands during generation. If enabled, generates a compile_commands.json file containing the exact compiler calls for all translation units of the project in machine-readable form. This option is implemented only by Makefile Generators and the Ninja. Once the cmake command is successful, we need to copy the compile_commands.json file to the LLVM_SRC path.

The commands used to build using ninja are as follows:
```.term1
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$LLVM_PATH $LLVM_SRC/llvm-8.0.0.src
```
Once the required build files are created, we can start building using ninja just like before.
```
ninja -j<NUM_OF_PROCESSOR>
```
ninja install installs all the built llvm/clang files to the LLVM_PATH location.
```.term1
ninja install
```

### A.5 Setting Environment Variables
Following environment variables need to be set before using llvm/clang
```.term1
export PATH=$LLVM_PATH:$PATH
```
```.term1
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LLVM_PATH/libexec:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
```.term1
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LLVM_PATH/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
```.term1
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LLVM_PATH/libexec:$LIBRARY_PATH
```
```.term1
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LLVM_PATH/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
```
```.term1
export MANPATH=$LLVM_PATH/share/man:$MANPATH
```
```.term1
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$LLVM_PATH/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
```
```.term1
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$LLVM_PATH/include:CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
```
Optional environment variables
```.term1
export CLANG_VERSION=8.0.0
```
```.term1
export CLANG_PATH=$LLVM_PATH
```
```.term1
export CLANG_BIN=$LLVM_PATH/bin
```
```.term1
export CLANG_LIB=$LLVM_PATH/lib
```


## <a name="openmp"></a> B. Building OpenMP with CMake
Once llvm is installed building OpenMP is pretty straight forward. Here also we can use ninja or make. Following tutorial is only for make build system.

### B.1 Prerequisite
The major prerequisite for building OpenMP with offloading support is that gcc version cannot be over 7. So either use gcc with version below 7, or disable gcc and use our currently built clang as compiler. In this tutorial we are using our llvm/clang compiler to build openmp.

### B.2 Download OpenMP
Get the OpenMP source code
```.term1
wget http://releases.llvm.org/8.0.0/openmp-8.0.0.src.tar.xz
```
Untar openmp-8.0.0.src.tar.xz
```.term1
tar -xf openmp-8.0.0.src.tar.xz
```

### B.3 Build with make
Goto openmp-8.0.0.src
```.term1
cd openmp-8.0.0.src
```
Create a build directory and get into it
```.term1
mkdir build && cd build
```
OpenMP building is quite small compared to llvm/clang. We can still use the ninja build system and TMPDIR to speedup our build process, but it won't make much of a difference.

Here we set the CMAKE_C_COMPILER and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to point to our current clang installation - $LLVM_PATH\bin\clang.

CLANG_OPENMP_NVPTX_DEFAULT_ARCH sets the default architecture when not passing the value during compilation. We should adjust the default to match the environment weâ€™ll be using most of the time. The architecture must be prefix with sm_, so Clang configured with the sm_60 command will build for the Tesla P100 by default.

LIBOMPTARGET_NVPTX_COMPUTE_CAPABILITIES applies to the runtime libraries: It specifies a list of architectures that the libraries will be built for. This is an important parameter. As we cannot run on GPUs without a compatible runtime, we should pass all architectures we care about. Also, please note that the values are passed without the dot, so compute capability 7.0 becomes 70. We can also build for multiple compute capabilities by separating them with a comma. For instance, if we want to build for compute capabilities 3.5, 6.0 and 7.0, then use the parameter as -DLIBOMPTARGET_NVPTX_COMPUTE_CAPABILITIES=35,60,70. We can only build for compute capabilities over 3.5

```.term1
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$LLVM_PATH -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$LLVM_PATH/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$LLVM_PATH/bin/clang++ -DCLANG_OPENMP_NVPTX_DEFAULT_ARCH=sm_35  -DLIBOMPTARGET_NVPTX_COMPUTE_CAPABILITIES=35 ..
```
As always make will build OpenMP

```.term1
make -j4
```
 and *make install* will install the built files into the assigned path, here $LLVM_PATH.
```.term1
make install
```

## C. Compiling code with offloading support
Note: The terminal on the right side does not have cuda installed. So you cannot really compile, link and run the OpenMP code with offloading support in the terminal. The instructions below are used to guide you to try it on a machine with cuda installed. 

To compile a code with OpenMP GPU offloading support we must provide some compile time parameters to clang. Most common parameters are:
```
clang -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda --cuda-path=<CUDA_INSTALL_PATH> -Xopenmp-target -march=sm_XX <file>
```
Here, 

* -fopenmp instructs clang that it need to compile an OpenMP code.
* -fopenmp-targets instructs clang to use nvptx64-nvidia-cuda as the target device.
* --cuda-path suggests the location where cuda is installed.  
* -Xopenmp-target -march set the target architecture. For instance, while building for P100 we should use -Xopenmp-target -march=sm_60, while for V100 we should use -Xopenmp-target -march=sm_70

Before using clang to build OpenMP code for GPU offloading, we should always check if the compatible runtime is present or not. For instance, if we need to build for compute capability 3.5 we should check whether the library libomptarget-nvptx-sm_35.bc is present in the directory  $LLVM_PATH/lib. If not, then we should rebuild OpenMP with support for that compute capability.

Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s all that you need to do to start using OpenMP with GPU support. 
Happy offloading!!
